# Pizza Sales Analysis Project

This repository contains a detailed analysis of pizza sales data, integrating SQL queries and Power BI dashboards.

## Project Overview

A comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data was performed using SQL in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and visualizations were built in Power BI.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Analysis with SQL in SSMS:
- SQL queries were written and executed in SSMS to gather key insights from the pizza sales dataset.
- The queries calculated KPIs such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, and more.
- Additional queries analyzed daily and monthly sales trends, and top/bottom pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders.

### 2. Data Import into Power BI:
- The extracted data from SSMS was imported into Power BI using a SQL Server connection.
- Power BI was used for further analysis and to build visual representations of the data.

### 3. Power BI Dashboards:
- Various dashboards were created in Power BI to visually represent the insights.
- Key visualizations include revenue trends, sales breakdowns by pizza category and size, and performance metrics of the top and bottom pizzas.

## Key Insights

- Top and bottom-selling pizzas by revenue and quantity.
- Analysis of sales performance across pizza categories and sizes.
- Identification of sales trends across different days and months.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** for writing and executing SQL queries.
- **Power BI** for importing data and creating dashboards.
